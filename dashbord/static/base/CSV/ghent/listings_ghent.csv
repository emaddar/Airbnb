In a small but cosy duplex apartment, with most of one floor for you?<br />Live like a local !<br /><br /><b>The space</b><br />The two floor apartment (80 m2 in total) is small but cosy, and part of a medieval house dating back to 1490 ! (you can see its front on the images). You get the upper floor/bedroom to yourself and I'm working and sleeping downstairs (when I'm home). For couples, 'full privacy' might be an issue, as there is no door separating the two floors, yet the room itself is L-shaped and the bed is behind this 'L'.<br />The bedroom floor is under the roof, a bit like an attic, has a couple of windows, no curtains (there are covers to make the room darker, but not totally dark), a double bed and a double floor mattress if needed. <br />Strangely so for a place in the center: the appartement is very quiet because we're on the back side of the house.<br /><br /><b>",3545702,Trui,100%,96%,"['email', 'phone']",Sluizeken - Tolhuis - Ham,51.06027,3.72539,Private room,,1 shared bath,"[""Iron"", ""Hot water"", ""Smoke alarm"", ""Kitchen"", ""Refrigerator"", ""Cooking basics"", ""Hair dryer"", ""Long term stays allowed"", ""Wifi"", ""Fire extinguisher"", ""Coffee maker"", ""Essentials"", ""Washer"", ""Microwave"", ""Stove"", ""Heating""]",$28.00,219
